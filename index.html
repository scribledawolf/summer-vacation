During my summer vacation I went to <i>miami florida</i> with some of my cousins from argentina,cordova, And stayed at the loews hotel. We spent our time mostly on the beach, at night we skateboarded on lincon street(which is a popular hangout place in downtown). Down there we ate shoped and watched the cool street preformances from three guys(dancing in 91f in black hoodies and long black pants). The best part of the trip was the food. Obviously we spent most of our time on the actual beach because that is a normal thing to do on the beach. We also saw alot of nice cars.
